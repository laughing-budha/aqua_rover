# Captsone project USYD

This repository contains code from the capstone project for the final year of my degree.

## Project Goal

In this project the goal is to use the MIT car and Donkey car hardware to build a self driving car.

During this project I worked on both the software and hardware development of the car. My role in the project had a particular focus on developing and training the Neural Network we used for navigation and integrating it with the car.

## Computer Vision

OpenCV was used to create depth maps from the stereo cameras.
